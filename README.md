# PYTHON SCRIPTS!
This repository is my first GitHub repository. This one contains Python programs that I made. They all work well on Windows (I use that OS.), and maybe Linux and MacOS (unless otherwise noted).
Feel free to review any of the code in this repository. Reviews are appreciated. They help code get better.
## Word counter
 Uploaded!
 You use commands to interact with this program. This is quite useful if you want to write a 50,000 word novel in a month and if you store the different chapters in separate files.
You might have to make some changes to the file before running it for the first time.
 How to use:
 STEP 1: In the first prompt, there are some commands you can type in, `add`, `remove`, `update`, or `quit`. You can just type in the first letter of those commands, and the script knows what you mean.
 ## Story Generator
 Not uploaded yet
 I need to fix some bugs on this one.
 This program is what you'll get if you combine Mad Libs with Rory Story Cubes or Storytime Dice.
 - It randomly generates stories.
 - It sometimes give the user opportunities to fill in some blanks with some input prompts.
 ## Subtitle Creator
 Not uploaded yet
 - Creates CSV subtitles
 - You can write transcripts of videos in .txt files and import them into the program.
 - Has options to capitalize and uncapitalize text inside parentheses or square brackets.
 - Also has options to randomly choose what brackets would be used and whether the text inside is capitalized or not.
 - Window is always on top of the video player window if you are watching the video you want to add subtitles to maximized.
 ## CSV editor
 Not uploaded yet
 This is a command-line interface tool that creates and edits CSV files.
 You type in commands to use it. It displays the contents of the CSV file you're working on in a neat table.
 
 ## And maybe more.
example.py file (I had to make it for doing a QwikLab exercise on a course on using Git and GitHub. I might have to delete it some day).
