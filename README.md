# PYTHON SCRIPTS!
This repository is my first GitHub repository. This one contains Python programs that I made. They all work well on Windows (I use that OS.), and maybe Linux and MacOS (unless otherwise noted).
 ## Story Generator
 Not uploaded yet
 I need to fix some bugs on this one.
 This program is what you'll get if you combine Mad Libs with Rory Story Cubes or Storytime Dice.
 - It randomly generated stories
 - It sometimes give the user opportunities to fill in some blanks with some input prompts.
 ## Subtitle Creator
 Not uploaded yet
 - Creates CSV subtitles
 - You can write transcripts of videos in .txt files and import them into the program.
 - Has options to capitalize and uncapitalize text inside parentheses or square brackets.
 - Also has options to randomly choose what brackets would be used and whether the text inside is capitalized or not.
 - Window is always on top of the video player window if you are watching the video you want to add subtitles to maximized.
 ## CSV editor
 Not uploaded yet
 This is a command-line interface tool that creates and edits CSV files.
 You type in commands to use it. It displays the contents of the CSV file you're working on in a neat table.
 ## Word counter
 Not uploaded yet
 Like the CSV editor, you use commands to interact with it. This is quite useful if you want to write a 50,000 word novel in a month and if you store the different chapters in different files.
 ## And maybe more.
example.py file (I had to make it for doing a QwikLab exercise on a course on using Git and GitHub. I might have to delete it some day).
