BROCCOLI SUBTITLE CREATOR MANUAL
=======
I created this program so that I can create subtitles on my computer.
I'll add more of this step by step because I thought I could do this in one commit, but my web browser crashed and I had to start over again. ðŸ˜ 
I'll upload the code soon. Please give me suggestions on what to add to this program or this manual.
## How To Use
>Step one: Open the video you want to add subtitles with.
>Step two: Add lines.
>Step three: Add Timings.
>Step four: Customize text within parentheses or square brackets.
>Step five: Export
>Step six: Watch the video with the subtitles.
