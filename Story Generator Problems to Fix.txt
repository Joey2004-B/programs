Story Generator Problems to Fix

To test: introduce_bad_guy(), location_specific(), new_mission()

For every time that the input() function is used, make the prompts appear before writing a full paragraph, so that the paragraphs appear in one piece without being interrupted by the input prompts. Except for conversation(). {Look at the part with "There are no good guys left".}

NameError: name 'new_place' is not defined. Did you mean: 'NewPlace'? (FIXED)

They got to Outer space by a(n) Van.

Meanwhile, at the Open ocean, Creepy Carrot saw the good guys out the window.

They were born in a desert.
  They got there by a(n) Car.

    The good guys found themselves at Somalia. However, they were still lost.
  The good guys weren't lost anymore.

  How come conversations are always over the phone?

make a NewPlace() function.
To test: introduce_bad_guy(), goto(), use_item(), goal_resolve(), natural_disaster(), trapped(), lost(), location_specific(), elevator()

Change the wording in the message in elevator() where someone tries to open the door.


In good_guy_check(), one good guy was introduced, and the text suggested that there were more than one.

In elevator(), if the good guys lose, add a sentence saying that the doors opened and the good guys came in.

In lost(), it's possible to have many consecutive paragraphs start with "The good guys," replace the second and third and so on with "they."

In conversation(), if someone asks a question at the end of the loop, let someone answer the question.

in the natural_disaster() function, there is a loop in the thunderstorm part, and as soon as the good guys were safe, the loop should break.

in kill_character(), make it possible to start a fight().

change wording in convert_character().

in list_vehicles(), use a dictionary to count them.


When there is only one good guy, replace "Good guy" with the name of the good guy. (Maybe creating a function for that will help.)

Make the fights shorter.

Add a way to start a fight() in lost().

Lose the phone part of conversation().

They got there by Airplane, a(n) and a(n) Bicycle.

if in-cage, you can't go anywhere.
